"""pit-adjuster: point-in-time fixed-basis back-adjustment engine.

Rebuild daily price history so that any day reads exactly what that day
could have known: fixed-basis hfq prices from current-vintage qfq bars plus
a point-in-time corporate-action archive, with verifiable inversion,
forward-adjustment drift detection and snapshot equivalence checks.

Zero dependencies. Python 3.11+.
